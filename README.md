# Critical-review-of-ML-to-diagnose-COVID

Critically reviewied Brinati et al’s attempt to apply ML to diagnose COVID by reviewing the methods and comparing to other papers. Suggested possible mistakes such as using the not 100% accurate PCR as ground truth, using a non-generalised population with age mean of 60, and not eliminating highly corellated variables in the models in order to satisfy Ockham’s razor.
